# Chapter 12: Greedy Algorithms

> **"Local optimization does not guarantee global perfection."**

## 🏛️ The Academic View
Greedy algorithms make the locally optimal choice at each step.

## 🏗️ The Engineering Reality
Sometimes "Good Enough" is perfect. Greedy algorithms are essential for compression (Huffman) and approximations where exact solutions take too long.

**Key Topics:**
* **Huffman Coding:** Reducing file size by analyzing frequency.
* **The Knapsack Approximation:** When to stop looking for the perfect packing.
