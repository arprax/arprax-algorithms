> **"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to recompute it."**

## 🏛️ The Academic View
DP is about breaking problems into overlapping sub-problems.

## 🏗️ The Engineering Reality
DP is simply **Caching**. It is the art of trading Memory (RAM) for Time (CPU).

**Key Topics:**
* **Memoization:** Decorating recursive functions to cache results.
* **Tabulation:** The iterative "Bottom-Up" approach to avoid recursion limits.
